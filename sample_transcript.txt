Lesson 1
 
Key Objectives

When and how to enter mean-reversion longs

Entry triggers and “perfect” setups

Cutting rules & trade management

Three Main Sections

Market Context (TradingView, Orion, Velo)

Entry Triggers (Perfect Tick, SFP, Deviation)

Trade Management (When to cut vs. hold)

1. Market Context
Quiet Environment

Prefer days when no coin is up/down more than ±10% on your watchlist

Low FOMO signal: if you don’t feel FOMO, likely few others do

Orion Tick Count & Volume

Look for tick counts and volumes below your recent averages

Harder to find coins meeting volume criteria → ideal for reversion

Relative Filters

No fixed “low” threshold—use discretion against recent 4–6 day history

If BTC ticks >100k in 5 min → consider momentum in BTC, not alts

Velo / Other Data

Spot return buckets should be balanced, not skewed

Low spot volume on big movers flags “false pumps”

2. Entry Triggers
Perfect Support Tick (A++)

Price touches a support level exactly (no tick below)

Next candle must immediately reverse upwards

High volume at the touch strengthens the signal

Swing Failure Pattern (SFP)

Wick pierces a level then closes back inside

Bonus: candle closes green with upper-wick extension

Volume at the wick base adds conviction

Clean Deviation & Return

Candle closes below support, then returns above

Short time in “offside” zone preferred

Only use when overall conditions are very favorable

Level Selection

For reversion: all swing lows except those with large “empty space” beyond

For momentum: only levels with empty space on the opposite side

3. Trade Management
Cut Quickly When…

Price grinds against you in a staircase fashion

A new market condition emerges (e.g. Bitcoin spikes in sync with the alt)

Hold Through…

Fast vertical spike against you (normal reversion pullback)

Choppiness at entry in a slow, boring environment

News & Anomalies

Watch out for outsized one-minute moves (> 10–15%)—check news first

Fake-news reversals can be lucrative, but trade cautiously

🔑 Key Takeaways
Context first: ensure low FOMO across TradingView, Orion, Velo

Trigger quality: perfect ticks and SFPs are highest-probability setups

Discretion matters: no hard numeric thresholds—use comparative history

Trade with conviction: cut on stair-step losses, hold on swift spikes

Lesson 2
Introduce “Duration of Regime” as a key context variable

Explain the trade-off between upside potential vs. win-rate

Apply the concept to June’s market conditions

1. The “Duration of Regime” Concept
Definition: How long a market pattern (trend or chop) has persisted.

Short-lived Patterns (e.g. 1 hr):

Trend: Early in move → high upside potential but low conviction (lower win-rate).

Chop: Limited conviction → not yet a reliable mean-reversion environment.

Long-lasting Patterns (e.g. 12 hrs):

Trend: High conviction for momentum trades; upside is smaller (late in cycle).

Chop: High conviction for mean reversion; fewer false signals.

Trade-off:

Early regime → big wins possible, but more losers.

Established regime → smaller moves, but higher win-rate and easier risk management.

2. Press-Start Analogy
“Press start” on your strategy exactly when the regime has run long enough to know which style to lean on.

Early press: High variance, step on the gas for potential big P&L swings.

Late press: Lower variance, focus on consistent smaller gains.

3. June Market Case Study
First 2 Weeks (Easy Mode for Mean Reversion):

Nearly impossible to find momentum setups.

Volume & ticks were unusually low → prime reversion environment.

Weekend Spike:

A sudden +15% move broke the monotony → regime was shifting.

Prompted a gradual “step back” from pure mean-reversion.

Second Half of June (Choppy Flip-Flop):

Markets swung between chop and trend every 2–4 hrs.

No sustained regime → required extreme selectivity or flat.

4. Prioritizing Variables
Duration (most important)

Price Approach to Level (spike vs. grind)

Subjective Context:

Twitter sentiment

Orion tick counts & volume

Velo / spot breadth

BTC direction

Rule of Thumb:

If duration doesn’t clearly favor one style, don’t trade.

A strong, persistent grind (≥ 12 hrs) trumps a one-off spike.

🔑 Key Takeaways
Always check how long the pattern has been running.

Decide early (big potential) vs. late (high conviction) entry.

Use duration as your north star; only then layer in entry triggers and subjective filters.

Lesson 3
Video Goals
Define “levels” (support & resistance) as batches of limit orders

Explain why “time spent away” from a level is the key to picking high-quality levels

Show how this drives trade management and average win-to-loss ratios

1. What Is a “Level”?
Support = area with many limit buy orders

Resistance = area with many limit sell orders

No “good” vs. “bad” levels by geometry—only by USD size of resting orders

2. Why Time Matters
Immediately after a level is formed, order book at that price is empty (orders just filled)

As time passes, more participants can place limit orders → batch size grows

Compare extremes:

1 minute after level → almost zero resting orders

87 days after all-time high → huge pool of orders

3. Impact on Trade Management
High-order levels → large market orders, violent reactions, less chop → easy to spot invalidation and cut small (e.g. 0.5 R)

Low-order levels → weak reactions, more chop → harder to manage → must give trade more room and accept larger loss (e.g. 0.9 R)

Result: more orders ⇒ higher average win-to-loss ratio (you win R but lose less on bad trades)

4. Practical Rule of Thumb
Pick any swing high/low (V-shaped turning point)

Require ≥ 1 hour spent away from that price before trading it

More time ⇒ stronger reaction (big orders), easier management

Win-rate unaffected; focus is on trade management and EV

🔑 Key Takeaways
Time spent away from level is the sole determinant of order-book depth

Use any timeframe—duration is unchanged across 1m, 15m, 4h, daily

Minimum 1 hour away ⇒ reliable level

Longer duration ⇒ easier management, higher average win-to-loss ratio

Don’t overthink timeframe or micro-level choice—destination is order size, not chart frame

Lesson 4
Show the full session routine from initial market scan to execution

Demonstrate how to update your market‐bias dynamically

Illustrate level selection and alert setup for systematic entries

1. Two Initial Objectives
Assess Market Conditions – determine whether to favor Momentum or Mean-Reversion, and Longs or Shorts.

Flag Candidates – identify 4–6 coins of interest for deeper analysis.

2. Step-By-Step Scan Process
Velo Return-Buckets

Check daily return distribution (heavily skewed ⇒ bias Longs or Shorts; neutral ⇒ no clear edge).

Example: extreme red buckets ⇒ bias towards Momentum Shorts.

TradingView “Spaghetti” Chart

Sort top gainers/losers; look for clean staircases or ranges.

Flag coins exhibiting strong patterns, then note if BTC is mirroring them.

Orion CLI Snapshot

Tick Counts & Volume: compare to your recent reference. “Unclear?”—bias stays unchanged.

High Activity Filters: tickCount > threshold, 5-min % change, 24-h % change → flag additional coins.

TradingView Watchlist %-Change

Identify anomalies in 1-day % moves vs. your norm.

Adjust bias only if these numbers are meaningfully higher or lower than your “usual.”

Frequency Check

Scan Orion again for frequency of clean staircases vs. choppy ranges.

Minor tweaks to bias if one pattern dominates.

Bias Evolution

Start “neutral” in center of a 2×2 grid (Momentum ↔ Mean-Rev, Longs ↔ Shorts).

Move the bias marker after each step.

Final bias drives minimum trade grade required:

E.g. Momentum Shorts ⇒ B+; Mean-Reversion Longs (against bias) ⇒ A+.

3. Level Selection & Alert Setup
Choose 2–3 levels per flagged coin (closest swing highs/lows with ≥1h time away).

Annotate your chart with notes:

“If fast spike → take trade” or “Only final candle close beyond.”

Minimum % move (e.g. 3%) if using market orders.

Set alerts on each level—don’t panic if they fire mid-scan; complete your process calmly.

4. Correlation Check
When alerts trigger, verify whether the move is driven by BTC:

If spike coincides with a BTC move of similar size/volume → skip the trade.

Otherwise treat as an “outlier” in your coin and proceed.

5. Execution Guidelines
Entry only when:

Price approaches your level in the pre-defined manner (fast spike, SFP, etc.).

Bias conditions still hold (no sudden regime shift).

Trade Management:

A clean, violent reaction → cut small if reversed.

Choppy/weak reaction → grant extra breathing room but accept larger stop-loss.

🔑 Key Takeaways
Systematic Biasing: follow the 5-step scan before touching your order entry UI.

Flexible Grades: set your minimum acceptable “signal grade” based on bias strength.

Correlate or Skip: always check BTC to distinguish genuine coin moves from broad‐market moves.

Calm Execution: complete your analysis first, then act—alerts are informational triggers, not commands.

Lesson 5
 Video Goals
Preparation: Set yourself up mentally and physically for success.

Market Scan: Systematically assess conditions and flag coin candidates.

Execution & Alerts: Trade your plan calmly and clearly.

Idle Time & Review: Use downtime to reinforce learning and improve.

Post-Session Debrief: Capture micro-improvements for compounding gains.

1. Preparation (Total ≈ 20 min)
Quick Exercise (1 min)

Any movement: push-ups, stretch, walk—just get blood flowing and endorphins up.

Mind Reset (5–15 min)

Meditation, music, breathing exercises—lift your mental state by 1 point for the next two hours.

Journal / Notes Review (5 min)

Refresh on yesterday’s mistakes & improvements.

Skim prior session screenshots for context.

Replay-Mode Warm-Up (5–10 min)

Do 5–10 min of fake (“replay”) trades—no P&L judgment, just muscle-memory for entries, stops, targets.

Why? Each small step compounds into smoother execution and fewer rookie mistakes.

2. Market Scan (≈ 10 min)
Quick Twitter & News Check (1–2 min)

Look for one-off anomalies (e.g. breaking news, unusual buzz).

Orion CLI Snapshot

Tick Count & Volume vs. your recent norm → spot regime changes.

Velo Return Buckets & “Spaghetti” Chart

Are returns heavily skewed (Longs vs. Shorts)?

Do top movers show clean staircases or ranges?

TradingView Watchlist

Sort by 1 day % change → flag the biggest gainers & losers (up to ~6 total).

Final Bias Mapping

Update your “Momentum ↔ Mean-Reversion” × “Long ↔ Short” grid after each step.

Decide your minimum signal grade for each strategy based on bias.

3. Level Selection & Alert Setup
Draw 2–3 Levels per flagged coin (swing highs/lows with ≥1 h time away).

Annotate Entry Rules on the chart (e.g. “Fast spike → entry,” “Candle close past → entry”).

Set Alerts calmly—treat them as information, not an order to panic-trade.

Correlation Check:
When an alert fires, verify whether the move is truly your coin’s or just BTC/Large-cap spillover.

4. Idle Time Tasks
Screenshot & Notes Review: Catch anything you missed.

Homework / Replay Drills: Practice new rules or strategies.

Education: Watch Loom/YouTube lessons, read trading articles.

Paper-Backtest: Quick hindsight trades to reinforce pattern recognition.

Peer Chats: DM other traders or discuss in Discord for fresh insights.

5. Post-Session Debrief (5–10 min)
Chart Review: Did you miss any entries, exits, or rules?

Checklist & Report Card: Mark off what you did/didn’t do.

Micro-Improvement Brainstorm:

Identify 0.1–1% tweaks (e.g. “Put phone on silent,” “Break after 3 consecutive losses”).

Even if you implement 30 of these over 100 sessions, that’s a 30% process boost.

🔑 Key Takeaways
Preparation is leverage: a calm mind and body amplifies your edge.

Systematic scan: follow each step in order before trading.

Bias + flexibility: know your “minimum grade” but stay open to counter-trades.

Calm execution: alerts = info, not panic triggers.

Compound micro-improvements: tiny gains accumulate into major performance lifts.

Lesson 6
Explain why Top-Tick Reversion signals occur more often when volume & volatility are low.

Show the entry/exit mechanics of a live 9 June trade example.

Demonstrate a second-case example from 20 June to reinforce the pattern.

1. Why Top-Tick Setups Flourish in Low Vol/Low Volumes
Low volatility ⇒ few market orders hitting resting limit orders

Limit orders absorb small market buys/sells, so price repeatedly tags the same tick

Each “top‐tick” failure to break becomes a high-probability mean-reversion trigger

The rarer the volatility, the more frequent these exact‐tick rejections become

2. Anatomy of a Top-Tick Entry
Identify a valid resistance (e.g. previous swing-high on daily → zoom down to confirm on 1 hr).

Set an alert for price touching that exact price point to the tick.

Entry: once price tags the level (no tick above) and the next candle closes red, enter a market sell.

Target: aim for the origin of the spike (any wick‐base within that cluster—EV difference is negligible).

FTA (First Trouble Area): place your first “invalidated” marker at the spike high; if price closes beyond it, exit for a scratch.

Secondary Level: optionally mark a second level to trail your stop once the trade moves favorably (e.g. move SL up to FTA).

3. Live Example: 9 June Trade
Level Discovery:

Found on daily via a swing‐high wick

Confirmed on 1 hr chart as a valid resistance

Entry: Price tagged 92.37 exactly → next candle red → market sell at close

Target: circa 91.92 (origin of spike); could also use adjacent wick‐bases with similar outcome

FTA: set at the spike high; any close above invalidates the idea

Management: after initial move, trail stop to entry area for breakeven on partial failure

4. Second Example: 20 June Signals
Two distinct coins each showed identical‐tick rejections on the same price

Even small rejections (under 2 % moves) illustrate that low volatility yields repeatable tags

Reinforces that exact-tick failure is the core edge—spike magnitude merely amplifies comfort

🔑 Key Takeaways
In quiet markets, hunt for exact-tick failures rather than big spikes.

Entry = next‐candle close against the level; no need to chase a fast move.

Target = any origin wick base; stop management is flexible due to high margin of error.

Practice spotting these on your watchlist during low-vol days to capture easy mean-reversions.
